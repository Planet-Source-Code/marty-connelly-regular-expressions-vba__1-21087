Regular Expressions
So what are regular expressions? Regular expressions provide tools for
developing complex pattern matching and textual search-and-replace algorithms.
Ask any Perl, egrep, or awk developer, and they'll tell you that regular expressions
are one of the most powerful utilities available for manipulating text and data.
By creating patterns to match specific strings, a developer has total control over
searching, extracting, or replacing data. In short, to master regular expressions
is to master your data. A lot of methods can be found in most Perl programming texts

 The VBScript RegExp object provides 3 properties and 3 methods to the user. 

Properties  
  Pattern    
  IgnoreCase    
  Global    

Pattern - A string that is used to define the regular expression. This must be set before
  use of the regular expression object.  
IgnoreCase - A Boolean property that indicates if the regular expression should be tested
  against all possible matches in a string. By default, IgnoreCase is set to False. 
Global - A read-only Boolean property that indicates if the regular expression
  should be tested against all possible matches in a string. By default, Global is set to False. 

Methods  
  Test (search-string)  
  Replace (search-string, replace-string)  
  Execute (search-string)  

Test (string) - The Test method takes a string as its argument and returns True if 
 the regular expression can successfully be matched against the string, 
 otherwise False is returned. 

Replace (search-string, replace-string) - The Replace method takes 2 strings as its arguments.
 If it is able to successfully match the regular expression in the search-string,
 then it replaces that match with the replace-string, and the new string is returned.
 If no matches were found, then the original search-string is returned. 

Execute (search-string) - The Execute method works like Replace, except that it returns
 a Matches collection object, containing a Match object for each successful match.
 It doesn't modify the original string. 

Regular Expressions tend to be faster than InStr or Like searches over large strings
by at least a factor of 2. A help file for Regular Expressions can be found in
JScript5.chm and VbScrip5.chm, these are contained in the Windows Scripting Host 2.0


Ok. Here is how to get at Regular Expressions from Access 97.
 Wish I had known this a year ago.

I assume you have installed Windows Scripting Host 2.0 fom Microsoft at
http://msdn.microsoft.com/scripting/

 This will give you access to vbscript.dll

 If you go to the tools reference window and search for this file with
 browse and check off vbscript.dll. You only get access to Microsoft
 VBScript Globals. So you have to force a reference to be added with
 code to get regular expressions references. Here is code to do it.
 This code cannot be executed in a MDE.


Function ReferenceFromFile(strFileName As String, _
              Optional Warning As Boolean) As Boolean

' One caveat adding a reference this way forces a decompile
' so cannot be used in an MDE. At least not executed inside one to
' reset references.

    Dim ref As Reference

    On Error GoTo Error_ReferenceFromFile
    Set ref = References.AddFromFile(strFileName)
    ReferenceFromFile = True

Exit_ReferenceFromFile:
    Exit Function

Error_ReferenceFromFile:
    If Warning = True Then MsgBox Err & ": " & Err.Description
    ReferenceFromFile = False
    Resume Exit_ReferenceFromFile
End Function


 Now call this function as follows depending on version required either
1.0 or 5.5 of VBScript Reqular Expressions. Version 5.5 has extra
objects to handle Multiline or SubExpressions. 

 Version 1.0

ReferenceFromFile "c:\Windows\System\vbscript.dll\2" , True

    or
Version 5.5

ReferenceFromFile "c:\Windows\System\vbscript.dll\3" , True

 You will see the references appear in your tools reference list or
look in Object browser.

 If I get carried away, I might write some sample code to use RegExpressions
to read a sample Report Page and convert to a CSV file or table.
 This access mdb just provides some sample code to show the utilization
of RegExp to parse strings and validate data entry, Yes there are probably bugs.
